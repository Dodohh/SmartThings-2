For *most* Powermax Express devices you will need to take power from the Powermax via a soldered connection, since most boards use an AC power supply and have no onboard DC connection. The easiest place to do this is on the two big capacitors, near where you plug in the AC power supply. Each capcitor has two pins (positive and negative), as you can see in the image, the Positive connections are joined together - we need to solder to either end of this PCB trace.
